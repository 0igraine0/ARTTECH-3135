1. Bookkeeping!
    - Make sure you can access the class forum here: https://ats.community/c/courses/arttech-3135.  If you can't, talk to me.  From this week forward, all class announcements will be posted on our private forum.  You are responsible for making sure that you get the announcements, so make sure you've got everything configured correctly.

2. Read!
    - Read: ofBook: [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)
        - Why? _You have to know how to draw!_
    - Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
        - Why? _This gives an overview of the important concept of Object Oriented Programming. We'll be covering this in class._
    - Read: [Version Control with Git](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/version_control_with_git.html)
        - Why? _Git is a tool that you'll use all the time in this class and in your future lives as Creative Coders. It's by far the most popular way to share and manage code and should become a bit like breathing as you develop code._
    - Become familiar with:
      - `ofPath`

3. Review Homework 0 solutions.

4. Watch!
    - Watch at least one of these videos [https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos).
        - Why: _The presenters at [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) and [INST-INT](http://inst-int.com/) are very influential in the field of Interactive Art / Creative Code.  Pay attention to them, but try not to be overwhelmed._

5. Create an Interactive Experimental Drawing Application
  - An experimental drawing application should ...
    - ... allow users / participants to "draw" using the mouse.
    - ... allow users / participants to affect the "drawing" using the keyboard.
    - ... allow the user to "`clear()`" the screen using a keyboard command.
      - e.g. For a vector called `std::vector<ofPoint> points;` consider clearing it using `points.clear();`.
    - Explore color, opacity, lines, shapes.
  - An experimental drawing application should not ...
    - ... attempt to do all of the things that existing drawing applications (e.g. Photoshop) already do.
    - ... minimize the use of `ofRandom` ... (ok, that's just my preference, it's not required).
    - ... take more than a few hours to build.

6. Take several screen shots of your best "drawing" and submit them with your code (we will talk about how to do this next week).
