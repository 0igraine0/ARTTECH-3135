1. Code
    - Natural Phenomena: Choose a natural phenomena, such as "fire, explosions, smoke, moving water (such as a waterfall), sparks, falling leaves, rock falls, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, stars and galaxies ..." ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)) and reproduce it as realistically as you can.
        - Extend our in class particle system to include a "Force".  This "force" is a small vector that is added to the acceleration every time
        - Create custom classes as needed.
        - One of your particle classes should demonstrate the ability to attach media such as a video, texture, 3d object, etc.
        - You must also incorporate sound.  This might be a background track or it could be a sound associated with each particle.  See the examples/sound for tips.
        - Hint: Consider working together and give yourself some time!
        - References for particle system parameters (some are not in C++, but the concepts are the same):
