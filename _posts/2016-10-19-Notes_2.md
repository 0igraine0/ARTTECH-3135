1. Addons!
  - [How to add an addon to a project](http://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/how_to_add_addon_to_project/)
  - What are addons?
    - Third party (i.e. not necessarily kept up to date by the core openFrameworks team) code modules that are experimental, often support specific hardware devices, etc.
    - They may provide an easy interface to an existing library (e.g. [https://github.com/bakercp/ofxClipper](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxClipper))
  - Where can I find addons?
    - [http://ofxaddons.com/](http://ofxaddons.com/)
      - Remember to look in the [http://ofxaddons.com/unsorted](http://ofxaddons.com/unsorted) and other tabs, as all of them haven't been categorized.
      - Sometimes a github search can turn up a few others.
  - What should I remember when using addons?
    - They are free! So their quality may vary. Every addon is an act of generosity! (the optimistic perspective)
    - There are LOTS of different addons that all may do effectively the same thing or wrap the same library so, make sure you look around a bit.
    - Things to look for when choosing an addon:
      - When was it last updated?
      - If the addon has been updated since the last openFrameworks release, it probably works.
      - Does the git repository have a lot of unanswered issues?
      - Does the addon have lots of stars on github?
      - Did the addon author take the time to follow our [addon template](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofxAddonTemplate) and even include a thumbnail? This can often be a good sign that they are writing quality addons.
      - Does the addon support your platform?  Some addons may work on one platform, but not another.
      - Does the addon just work with project generator or does the author require additional manual steps (e.g. to add a framework to the project, or move files manually)?
      - Does the addon provide examples?
  - When I run the example in the addon, it doesn't compile?
    - Delete all of the project files and regenerate them with Project Generator.  
    - If it still doesn't work, check the forum or the issues list in the the addon's github site.
  - Why do I have to use Project Generator (PG)?
    - For many addons, you can simply drag them into the file tree of your projects ... but not all.
    - For most complex addons that include 3rd party libraries (e.g. ofxKinect, etc), it is not enough to drag the addon into your project.  You must also set the library search paths, etc manually which is complex.
    - Use the Project generator! It's there to make this process easier.  If you forget to add an addon, just point PG to your project folder, add the addon and re-generate.
  - You'll notice when you add an addon, it adds the named addon to the `addons.make` file.  This will auto-populate the addon list in project generator.
  - Notice the licensing requirements for some libraries.  For the most part openFrameworks and addons can be used for any project, private or commercial.  Some require a fee or license if the addon is used commercially (e.g. [https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)).
  - Some addons require other addons (e.g. [https://github.com/bakercp/ofxHTTP](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxHTTP))!  Check the README, where this is usually mentioned.
  - Some addons might not require other addons, but the more interesting examples might.

2. Addon testing!
  - ofxGui (built-in)
    - This library just adds some extra functionality.  It is written with openFrameworks and requires no 3rd party libraries.
    - Check out the ofxGui example provided w/ openFrameworks.
    - Create a new project with ofxGui.
      - Make it control the radius of a circle.
      - Make it control the color (RGB) of a circle's fill.
  - [ofxBox2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d)
    - This wraps the [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) 2D physics library.  You may have seen it used in games like Angry Birds.
    - Run a few demos.
  - [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
    - This wraps an existing library written by Jason Saragih.
    - There are _lots_ of examples of neat stuff you can do with this library.
    - Run a few demos.
  - [ofxKinect2](https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinectV2)
    - This wraps libfreenect2 and libusb.
    - You must have USB3 for this to work.
    - You must also make sure that the openCL.frameworks is included.
    - Most examples here should work with other KinectV1 examples (contour finding, etc).
    - Run the demo.
  - ofxKinect (built-in)
    - This wraps libfreenect and libusb.

3. Workshop!
  - For teams of 2.
  - Choose an input addon either ofxFaceTracker or ofxKinect (1 or 2)
  - Create a custom (or modified) particle system that takes input from one of the two addons to create an interactive experience.
  - How to?
    - Explore the existing examples a bit.
    - Talk with your partner about what you want to try to accomplish.
    - Figure out what examples (from the addon and from our class) would be good places to start.
    - Understand the "coordinate systems" of with the kinect or the face tracker.
      - We've been using pixels on the screen.  How will you map from the coordinate systems of the Kinect / Face tracker to screen pixels?  Is it already done for you?
    - Create the piece.
