1. Bookkeeping!
    - Make sure all past assignments are submitted.
2. Review Concepts
    - [Review Pointers](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointers.htm)
        - What is a pointer?
        - What are they good for?
        - What are the meanings of `new` and `delete`?
        - Why is it best to avoid them?
    - [Review Reference](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_references.htm)
        - What are references?
        - What are they good for?
        - How do they differ from pointers?
    - What are "Smart Pointers"?
    - [Review Memory](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_dynamic_memory.htm) - Stack (`int a = 3;`) vs. Heap (`int* a = new int; *a = 3;`)
        - What is the difference between the "heap" and the "stack"?

2. Watch Getting Started with Xcode Video
    - To Be Posted

3. Code
    - Natural Phenomena: Choose a natural phenomena, such as "fire, explosions, smoke, moving water (such as a waterfall), sparks, falling leaves, rock falls, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, stars and galaxies ..." ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)) and reproduce it as realistically as you can.
        - Create custom classes as needed.
        - One of your particle classes should demonstrate the ability to attach media such as a video, texture, 3d object, etc.
        - Hint: Consider working together and give yourself some time!
        - References for particle system parameters (some are not in C++, but the concepts are the same):
            - [http://buildnewgames.com/particle-systems/](http://buildnewgames.com/particle-systems/) / [http://city41.github.io/particle.js/](http://city41.github.io/particle.js/)
            - [http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/)
            - [Pictures for Inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?q=particle+system+examples&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=757&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CEEQsARqFQoTCOCC1LCGo8gCFUeKDQodcWUCww)

4. Submit the results of step 3 to our new private github repository.  Follow the same instructions posted in the video, but this time place it in the `Assignment_4` folder.  Please do this before class starts.
