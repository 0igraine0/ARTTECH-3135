How do you describe a face?
- Usually in terms of its features.
- Sometimes in terms of its functions.

Even though there is a _huge_ variety in faces, usually things classified as a "face" will generally have the same set of features.
  - Hair length
  - Hair color
  - Eye size ()
  - Eye color (brown, green, blue, hazel, etc)
  - Nose length (long, short)
  - Nose width (narrow, wide)
  - Skin tone (dark, olive, light, tan, olive, pale, etc)
  - Skin texture (smooth, rough, etc)

We can also describe a face in terms of the things that it does -- its "functions"
  - Eyes could blink
  - Lips could smile
  - Eyebrows could raise

Sometimes these functions will of a face will directly modify how the "features" are perceived


When we create a "class" in programming, we must first identify
  - features
  - functions
that every instance of the given "class" will have.
