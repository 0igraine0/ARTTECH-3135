1. Bookkeeping!
    - Make sure all past assignments are submitted.
2. Review Concepts
    - [Review Pointers](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointers.htm)
        - What is a pointer?
        - What are they good for?
        - What are the meanings of `new` and `delete`?
        - Why is it best to avoid them?
    - [Review Reference](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_references.htm)
        - What are references?
        - What are they good for?
        - How do they differ from pointers?
    - What are "Smart Pointers"?
    - [Review Memory](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_dynamic_memory.htm) - Stack (`int a = 3;`) vs. Heap (`int* a = new int; *a = 3;`)
        - What is the difference between the "heap" and the "stack"?

2. Watch Getting Started with Xcode Video
    - To Be Posted


4. Submit the results of step 3 to our new private github repository.  Follow the same instructions posted in the video, but this time place it in the `Assignment_4` folder.  Please do this before class starts.

5. Revise Project Proposal for Mid-Term Project - Submit it to github like you did for the first project proposal. The mid-term project should be something that you can complete in 3-4 weeks and it should not move too far outside of what we have covered in class so far.
