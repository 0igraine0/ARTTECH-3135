1. Extend the Snake game created in class.  If you have trouble getting started, let us know on the forum!  Work together with others.  You can find starting code [here](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Week_06/BasicSnake).  Your job is to extend the game in a way that you will find interesting and may contribute to research for your future project.  Extend it in 3 or more of the following ways:
    - Video / Image:
        - When the game is complete, play a video in the background of the playing field (see `ofVideoPlayer`).
        - Instead of drawing the various components (head, body, etc), use images or videos in their place (see `ofImage`).
    - Sound (see `ofSoundPlayer`)
        - Add a sound track.
        - Make the sound track speed up or change with every point scored.
        - Add sound effects when the collisions or other events occur.
    - Typography
        - Create a scoreboard that uses a True Type Fonts, rather than a bitmap string (see `ofTrueTypeFont`).
    - Artificial Intelligence
        - Implement a piece of food that tries to escape.
        - Implement another snake that tries to get to the food before you do.
    - Playing field
        - Implement "obstacles" on the field.
    - Game Play
        - Make a 2+ player version.  Each player controls their own snake.
        - Make a 3D version of Snake.  Instead of the field modeled as 2d rows / columns, add a 3rd dimension.
